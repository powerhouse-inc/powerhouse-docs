# **Part 1: Powerhouse General Framework and Open-Source Capitalism**

Powerhouse emerged in the wake of Ethereum’s DAO movement, which began gaining momentum after the collapse of *The DAO* in 2016. This turning point spurred the creation of blockchain-enabled organizations capable of operating without centralized corporate structures. Over the years, governance systems and decentralized operational tools have advanced, paving the way for the next generation of organizations across chains like Solana, Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, and beyond. Powerhouse aims to advance these principles and build large, global organizations around networks.

Powerhouse operates at the intersection of open-source innovation and decentralized coordination. This section outlines the philosophical foundation and systemic structure that guides its operations and vision—what we call “Open-Source Capitalism.”


## **Why Open-Source Capitalism?**

Capitalism is the most powerful system of economic coordination ever invented. It incentivizes productivity, innovation, and risk-taking. But just as important—open-source has proven to be one of the most powerful engines of innovation within that system.

Open-source unlocks coordination across boundaries: between companies, communities, and individuals. It builds shared infrastructure at unprecedented speed, allows bottom-up experimentation, and lowers barriers to participation. This is why Big Tech, for all its closed platforms and walled gardens, has embraced open-source at the core of its own operations—releasing projects like React, Kubernetes, and TensorFlow not out of charity, but because open collaboration is often the best way to build foundational technology.

Yet this dynamic is incomplete. While open-source has dominated infrastructure, it has consistently struggled to capture value—particularly in consumer applications and services. The common assumption is that the challenge is distribution: how to equitably allocate funding, resources, and decision-making. But Open-Source Capitalism takes a broader view. Before we can redistribute value, we have to make sure value is being captured in the first place.

That’s the central promise of Open-Source Capitalism: not just to build open alternatives, but to make them self-sustaining, investable, and scalable. It’s about combining the pro-market, pro-innovation ethos of open-source with incentive structures that actually work—so we can build networks that don’t just survive, but thrive.


## **Four Principles of Open-Source Capitalism**



1. **Coordination Through Marketplace Platforms** Open-Source Capitalism demands new types of platforms—public marketplaces where contributors, customers, and investors can interact transparently. Like Uber or Airbnb, these marketplaces optimize for liquidity and coordination, but with open governance and ownership. \

2. **Incentive Alignment via Tokens and Revenue Sharing** Powerhouse uses Proof of Work Tokens (POWTs) to compensate contributors fairly over time, enabling deferred compensation models that align long-term incentives. \

3. **Reinvestment Through Revenue-Generating Hubs** Monetized OSS must funnel returns back to the contributors. The RGH (Revenue Generating Hub) manages licensing, sales, and commercial transactions in alignment with decentralized values. \

4. **Make Open Source Investable** By enabling investor flows through the Operational Collateral Fund (OCF), open-source projects gain sustainable funding channels. Returns are tied to the downstream use of open infrastructure. \



## **Decentralized Operations and Collaboration**

Open-Source Capitalism doesn’t work without new organizational structures. DAOs promised a way forward, but fell short: plagued by coordination failures, incentive misalignment, and lack of clarity around roles, responsibilities, and execution. Powerhouse emerged from this gap—building systems that retain the openness of decentralized networks while introducing the operational rigor of traditional institutions.

At the core of this approach is a belief in structured decentralization. Powerhouse enables independent teams to coordinate around shared goals, using workflows encoded in software rather than enforced by hierarchy. Contributors take ownership over workstreams, reputations are built over time, and budgets are allocated based on transparent processes. This is not decentralization for its own sake—it is a functional reimagining of how work gets done at scale.

Transparency plays a critical role. Rather than relying on opaque decision-making or internal politics, Powerhouse makes contributions, decisions, and payments legible. Governance and compensation are traceable across time, creating a persistent and auditable record of organizational behavior. The result is a system that fosters trust not just between individuals, but across entire networks.

This is what makes Powerhouse unique: it’s not just about running decentralized software—it’s about running decentralized organizations. Open-Source Capitalism is the economic philosophy. Scalable Network Organizations are the structure. And these principles come to life through the operational frameworks that guide every action on the network.
