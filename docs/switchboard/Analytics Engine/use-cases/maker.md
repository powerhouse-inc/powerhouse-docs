### Guidelines for Selecting and Combining Dimensions

1. Understand the Purpose of Analysis: Before selecting dimensions, clarify the objective of your analysis. Are you looking to track expenses for a specific project, analyze budget utilization, or examine transaction patterns? Your objective will guide which dimensions are most relevant.

2. Choose Relevant Dimensions: Select dimensions that align with your analytical goals. For instance, use the 'Project' dimension for project-based financial tracking or 'Wallet' for blockchain transaction analysis.

3. Combining Dimensions for Depth: Combine multiple dimensions to gain more nuanced insights. For example, you might combine 'Budget' and 'Category' to understand how different categories of expenses contribute to overall budget utilization within a specific area.

4. Hierarchy and Path Considerations: Pay attention to the hierarchical structure in dimension paths. For instance, paths like atlas/scopes/SUP/I/PHOENIX/ suggest a structured breakdown that can be crucial for detailed analysis.

5. Utilize Descriptions for Context: Where available, use the descriptions provided with dimension values to understand the context and relevance of each dimension to your analysis. This is particularly helpful in dimensions with null labels, where the path and description provide critical information.

6. Avoid Over-Complication: While combining dimensions can provide depth, avoid overly complex combinations that might lead to confusing or inconclusive results. Stick to combinations that directly serve your analysis objectives.

7. Use Icons for Quick Reference: Where icons are available, they can be used as a quick visual reference to identify different dimensions or categories, particularly in user interfaces where rapid identification is beneficial.

8. Experiment and Iterate: Don’t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of dimensions to see which provide the most meaningful insights. The flexibility of the dimensions allows for various permutations and combinations to suit diverse analytical needs.

9. Stay Updated: Keep abreast of any changes or additions to the dimensions within the analytics engine, as this can impact ongoing and future analyses.

### Currency

To specify the currency in your analytics queries, use the following approach:

1. Setting the Currency: Specify the currency as either "DAI" or "MKR" in the currency field of your filter object, depending on which currency's data you wish to analyze.

2. Query Example:

```graphql
query Analytics($filter: AnalyticsFilter) {
  analytics(filter: $filter) {
    series {
      period
      start
      end
      rows {
        dimensions {
          name
          path
        }
        metric
        unit
        value
        sum
      }
    }
  }
}

```

With filters for MKR:

```graphql
{
  "filter": {
    "start": "2023-01-01",
    "end": "2024-01-01",
    "granularity": "total",
    "metrics": ["Budget"],
    "dimensions": [{"name": "budget", "select": "atlas", "lod": 3}],
    "currency": "MKR"
  }
}
```
This query will return budget data in MKR for the specified time frame and dimension.

3. Consistency in Currency Specification: It's essential to be consistent in specifying the currency for each query. If your analysis involves comparing data across both DAI and MKR, ensure that separate queries are made for each currency and the results are appropriately labeled and distinguished.

4. Impact of Currency Choice: The choice of currency can significantly impact the insights derived from the analytics. While DAI provides a stable measure for financial planning and tracking, MKR offers insights into governance and decision-making aspects of the ecosystem.

By appropriately specifying the currency in your queries, you can tailor the financial analysis to suit the specific needs of your investigation, whether it be transactional stability with DAI or governance dynamics with MKR.

### Examples of Filter Configurations

1. Analyzing MKR Budgets for a Specific Period:

```graphql
{
  "filter": {
    "start": "2023-01-01",
    "end": "2024-01-01",
    "granularity": "total",
    "metrics": ["Budget"],
    "dimensions": [
      {
        "name": "budget",
        "select": "atlas",
        "lod": 3
      }
    ],
    "currency": "MKR"
  }
}
```
This configuration fetches total MKR budget data for the entire year of 2023, focusing on the 'budget' dimension with a specific level of detail.

2. Comprehensive Yearly Financial Analysis in DAI:

```graphql
{
  "filter": {
    "start": "2023-01-01",
    "end": "2023-12-31",
    "granularity": "annual",
    "metrics": ["Actuals", "Forecast"],
    "dimensions": [
      {
        "name": "category",
        "select": "atlas",
        "lod": 2
      }
    ],
    "currency": "DAI"
  }
}

```
This filter setup is designed to provide an annual overview of actuals and forecast data across all categories in DAI for the year 2023.

These examples demonstrate how to construct a complete filter object for different types of financial analysis. By properly defining each parameter, users can ensure accurate and relevant data retrieval from the analytics engine.

### Multicurrency Series

#### Overview

The `multiCurrencySeries` is a new feature introduced to the MakerDAO Analytics Engine, which significantly enhances the engine's capabilities by allowing for currency conversions within the data analytics process. This addition enables users to view financial data in multiple currencies, making the analytics engine a powerful tool for international financial analysis and reporting.

#### Functionality

**Currency Conversion**: The `multiCurrencySeries` enables the conversion of financial data from the base series currency (such as MKR) into another specified currency (like DAI).

The conversion is based on the available price change metrics in the analytics engine. To see all available price change metrics in the engine, use the metricsfield in the query to get a list:

```graphql	
 "metrics": [
        "Actuals",
        "Budget",
        "Contributors",
        "DailyDaiPriceChange",
        "DailyEthPriceChange",
        "DailyMkrPriceChange",
        "DailyUsdcPriceChange",
        "DailyUsdpPriceChange",
        "Forecast",
        "PaymentsOffChainIncluded",
        "PaymentsOnChain",
        "ProtocolNetOutflow"
      ],
```

So far the engine covers the below price change metrics.

```graphql
"DailyDaiPriceChange",
"DailyEthPriceChange",
"DailyMkrPriceChange",
"DailyUsdcPriceChange",
"DailyUsdpPriceChange",
```

In the future, there could become more metrics available for different purposes, such as Monthly`currency` PriceChange. These can be used in the `multiCurrencySeries` to get the required data.

**Flexibility**: Users can now request and analyze financial data in different currencies, providing flexibility for international stakeholders who operate in various monetary units.

#### How it works

1. Base Series Currency: Initially, the analytics engine aggregates data in the base currency of the series. For example, budget numbers might be originally calculated in MKR.

2. Conversion Request: Through the multiCurrencySeries, a user can request these figures to be converted into another currency, such as DAI.

3. Conversion Mechanism: The engine utilizes the daily average exchange rates to convert the data from the base currency to the target currency.

4. Data Retrieval: The converted data is then retrieved as part of the analytics query, allowing users to analyze financials directly in the currency of their choice.

#### Query Structure

The query structure for fetching multicurrency data is similar to the standard analytics query, with the addition of the `multicurrencySeries` field and relevant subfields for specifying the conversion criteria.

```graphql
query MultiCurrencySeries($filter: MultiCurrencyConversions) {
  analytics {
    multiCurrencySeries(filter: $filter) {
      period
      start
      end
      rows {
        dimensions {
          name
          path
        }
        metric
        unit
        value
        sum
      }
    }
  }
}

// Variables
{
  "filter": {
    "start": "2023-10-01",
    "end": "2024-01-01",
    "granularity": "monthly",
    "metrics": [
      "Budget"
    ],
    "dimensions": [
      {
        "name": "budget",
        "select": "atlas",
        "lod": 1
      }
    ],
    "currency": "DAI",
    "conversions": [
      {
        "metric": "DailyMkrPriceChange",
        "sourceCurrency": "MKR"
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

**Example Use Case**

- **Budget Analysis in Different Currencies**: A user can analyze the MakerDAO budget in both MKR and DAI, viewing how the budget figures translate between the governance token and the stablecoin. This can be particularly useful for reports that need to present financial data in a currency that is more widely used or understood by the audience.

#### Writing Queries

Writing queries in the analytics engine involves constructing structured requests to retrieve specific data. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you write a basic query.

**Step 1: Understand Your Data Requirements**

Before writing a query, clearly define what data you need. Determine the metrics, time period, granularity, dimensions, and currency relevant to your analysis.

**Step 2: Open Your GraphQL Interface**

Access the analytics engine through a GraphQL interface, like Apollo Studio or another GraphQL client.

**Step 3: Start with the Query Structure**

Every query begins with the keyword query, followed by an optional name, and the main query field. In our case, it’s `Analytics`:

```graphql
query MyAnalyticsQuery {
  analytics {
    series(filter: $filter)
    ...
  }
}

```

**Step 4: Define the Filter Object**

The `filter` object is crucial and must be complete. It includes parameters like start, end, granularity, metrics, dimensions, and currency. Define this object according to your data requirements:

```graphql
{
  "filter": {
    "start": "2023-01-01",
    "end": "2023-12-31",
    "granularity": "monthly",
    "metrics": [
      "Budget",
      "Actuals"
    ],
    "dimensions": [
      {
        "name": "budget",
        "select": "atlas",
        "lod": 1
      }
    ],
    "currency": "DAI"
  }
}
```

**Step 5: Specify the Data to Retrieve**

In the body of the `analytics` field, specify what data you want to retrieve. This typically includes fields like `series`,`period`,`start`,`end`,`rows` , and any sub-fields under `rows` such as `metric` , `value` , `unit` , `sum` , and `dimensions`. For example:

```graphql
query MyAnalyticsQuery($filter: AnalyticsFilter) {
  analytics {
    series(filter: $filter) {
      period
      start
      end
      rows {
        dimensions {
          name
          path
          label
          description
          icon
        }
        metric
        unit
        value
        sum
      }
    }
  }
}

```

**Step 6: Execute the Query**

Once you have constructed the query, execute it in your GraphQL interface. Ensure that the filter object is passed correctly as a variable. In most interfaces, there’s a separate section or panel where you can define these variables.

**Step 7: Review the Results**

After executing the query, review the results to ensure they align with your expectations. If the results are not as expected, revisit your query to check for any errors or adjustments needed in the filter parameters.

**Step 8: Iterate and Refine**

Query writing is often an iterative process. Based on the initial results, you might need to refine your query for more precise data or broader insights.

By following these steps, you can effectively write and execute queries in the analytics engine, tailoring the data retrieval to your specific analytical needs.

### Query Examples

Example 1: Fetching Total MakerDAO Actual Expenses and Budget for 2023

```graphql
query Analytics($filter: AnalyticsFilter) {
  analytics {
    series(filter: $filter) {
      period
      start
      end
      rows {
        dimensions {
          name
          path
        }
        metric
        unit
        value
        sum
      }
    }
  }
}

// Filter
{
  "filter": {
    "start": "2023-01-01",
    "end": "2024-01-31",
    "granularity": "total",
    "metrics": [
      "Budget",
      "Actuals"
    ],
    "dimensions": [
      {
        "name": "budget",
        "select": "atlas",
        "lod": 1
      }
    ],
    "currency": "DAI"
  }
}
```

Explanation

- This query fetches the total actual expenses and budget for MakerDAO for the entire year of 2023.
- The granularity is set to "total" to aggregate data across the whole year.
metrics include "Actuals" and "Budget" to get both actual spendings and budgeted amounts.
- The currency is set to "DAI" to ensure all financial data is in the DAI format.

Modification for Custom Use Cases
